1. ####The 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars

a. Safety and Security:  Cadence enhances productivity while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security.  Safety and security are critical in smart contracts because of the rigid nature of blockchains, and because they often deal with high-value assets. 

b. Clarity: Code needs to be easy to read,  especially Smart Contract code so that we, as users, can undertand and take decisions comfortably.Candence gives developers freedom to express their intentions directly by making the code declarative. These intentions are very clear by design, which, along with readability, make auditing and reviewing more efficient.

c. Approachability: The way Cadence is written is very familiar to other programming languages.Transition to it is quite easy if you have preliminary experience

d. Developer Experience: The developer should be able to debug in an uncomplicated manner, understand what does where, and not feel disappointed. Cadence does this by making error messages very clear.
